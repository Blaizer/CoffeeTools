 TAS RECORDING AND PLAYBACK
- Whenever you create a savestate, a recording with all your inputs up to that point is
  saved to a [.ctas] file. You can load earlier savestates to undo parts of the recording.
- Once you're done recording, you can find your recorded [.ctas] file in [%localappdata%/ufo50/coffeetools].
  For example: When playing on profile 2 and saving to slot 3, the final recording will be [savestate2-3.ctas].
- To view a [.ctas] file, rename the file to [play.ctas] and it'll be played back when you next launch the game.

 PORTING A SAVESTATE USING .CTAS PLAYBACK
- If you try to load a savestate that was made in an older version of CoffeeTools, it likely won't work,
  but you can still recover your progress using the [.ctas] file that was created alongside your savestate!
- Rename the file to [play.ctas] and let UFO 50 play back the recorded inputs. (Feel free to speed it up!)
- When all of your inputs have been played back, save the savestate and it'll now be ready to use again.
